During the recent network configuration audit, the technician noted an unusual device with the IPv4 address 192.168.1.105 connected to the main subnet, while the expected server was operating normally at 10.0.0.42. This rogue connection displayed a physical hardware address of 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E, which did not match any registered inventory items. Additional scrutiny of the system logs revealed two other non-standard MAC addresses: A4-B5-C6-D7-E8-F9 and 12:34:56:78:90:AB, suggesting multiple unauthorized access points. The security team has also requested a check of related mobile device identifiers, including the unusual IMEIs 356789012345678, 990000123456789, and 112233445566778 found associated with temporary access logs. The team has been alerted to investigate these specific identifiers, which appear in various standard formats.
